# ProjectGarage Integration Patterns

Multiple proven approaches for integrating projectGarage into your development workflow. Choose the pattern that best fits your project structure and team preferences.

## Available Integration Patterns

### 1. Git Submodule + Direct Usage (Lightweight)
**Best for**: Small teams, rapid prototyping, simple project structures

- Direct access to garage commands via submodule
- Minimal local storage overhead
- Always up-to-date with latest patterns

[→ Setup Guide](submodule-direct/README.md)

### 2. Git Submodule + Memory Bank (Comprehensive)
**Best for**: Large teams, complex projects, offline-first workflows

- Local cache of imported patterns with adaptations
- Project-specific customizations preserved
- Offline access to key patterns

[→ Setup Guide](submodule-memorybank/README.md)

### 3. Manual Copy (Simple)
**Best for**: One-off projects, learning phase, restricted environments

- Copy individual commands as needed
- No git submodule dependency
- Full local control

## Quick Comparison

| Pattern | Complexity | Sync | Offline | Customization | Team Size |
|---------|------------|------|---------|---------------|-----------|
| Submodule + Direct | Low | Auto | Limited | Low | Small |

| Manual Copy | Very Low | Manual | Full | Full | Any |

## Philosophy

**"Every project teaches something. Every learning prevents future pain."**

The goal is compound learning across projects - each project starts from a higher baseline by leveraging insights from previous work. Choose the integration pattern that makes this natural and sustainable for your context.
