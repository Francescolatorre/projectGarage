# Handover Pattern - Cross-Project Knowledge Transfer

## Pattern Overview
A standardized approach for transferring knowledge, context, and learnings between Claude instances and across different projects using a shared repository.

## Key Components

### 1. Shared Repository Structure
```
projectGarage/
├── claude-commands/           # Reusable commands across projects
│   ├── productivity/         # Process improvement commands
│   └── patterns/            # Development patterns
├── insights/                # Project-specific learnings
│   ├── project-name/        # Organized by project
│   └── cross-project/       # Universal insights
└── patterns/               # Documented patterns and templates
```

### 2. Standardized Integration Interface
```bash
# Consistent CLI across all projects
./garage-link browse <category>
./garage-link search <pattern>
./garage-link sync
./garage-link import <pattern>
./garage-link share <topic>

# NPM scripts integration
npm run garage:browse
npm run garage:sync
npm run garage:share
```

### 3. Knowledge Transfer Protocol

#### For Claude Instances:
1. **Context Preservation**: Document current working context in memory_bank/current/
2. **Pattern Extraction**: Identify reusable patterns and approaches
3. **Insight Sharing**: Use `./garage-link share "topic"` to export learnings
4. **Cross-Reference**: Import relevant patterns from other projects

#### For Human Handovers:
1. **Status Documentation**: Clear project state and next steps
2. **Pattern References**: Point to relevant garage patterns
3. **Context Links**: Reference specific files and approaches used
4. **Integration Instructions**: How to continue with existing patterns

## Implementation Benefits

### Cross-Claude Consistency
- Same interface reduces learning curve
- Shared patterns ensure consistent approaches
- Knowledge compounds across projects

### Project Continuity
- Preserved context enables smooth transitions
- Documented patterns reduce re-work
- Standardized tools work across environments

### Knowledge Accumulation
- Each project contributes back to shared knowledge
- Patterns evolve and improve over time
- Best practices become accessible to all projects

## Usage Examples

### Daily Workflow
```bash
# Import proven patterns at project start
./garage-link import "react-patterns"
./garage-link import "process-improve"

# Share new learnings during development
./garage-link share "authentication-approach"

# Sync insights before major handovers
./garage-link sync
```

### Handover Process
```bash
# 1. Document current state
./scripts/share_learning.sh "current-project-status"

# 2. Export key patterns discovered
./garage-link share "custom-patterns-developed"

# 3. Full sync to projectGarage
./garage-link sync

# 4. Commit changes for next Claude instance
cd .garage && git commit -m "Handover: project state and learnings"
```

## Pattern Maturity
- **Status**: Implemented and tested
- **Projects**: learnplatform, TikTok SaaS
- **Reusability**: High - universal across project types
- **Maintenance**: Self-maintaining through git submodules

## Integration Requirements
1. Git submodule: `git submodule add https://github.com/Francescolatorre/projectGarage.git .garage`
2. CLI wrapper: Copy `garage-link` script
3. NPM scripts: Add garage:* commands to package.json
4. Memory bank: Establish local adaptation layer

This pattern enables seamless knowledge transfer and ensures compound learning across all projects and Claude instances.
